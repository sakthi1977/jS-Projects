Hello Everyone!!!

I'm just a beginner in coding... Learning & practicing HTML, CSS, jS & MERN stack as well.

This is a simple To-do / Task Manager Program.

jS highlights :| forEach | addEventListener | parse | stringfy |

Buttons previous & next, yet to complete.

Duplicate Task Removal, yet to complete.

Styles applied may adapt with only laptop & few mobile portrait views, yet to update for mobile landscapes & other gadgets.

Day by day, will try to enhance this further better...
