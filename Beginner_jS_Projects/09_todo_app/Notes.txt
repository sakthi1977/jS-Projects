Hello Everyone!!!

I'm just a beginner in coding... Learning & practicing HTML, CSS, jS & MERN stack as well.

This is a simple To-do / Task Manager Program.

jS highlights :| forEach | addEventListener | parse | stringfy |

Buttons previous & next, yet to complete.

Duplicate Task Removal, yet to complete.

Styles applied may fit with only laptops screens, yet to complete for other gadgets.

Day by day, will try to enhance this further better...
