Hello Everyone!!!

I'm just a beginner in coding... Learning & practicing HTML, CSS, jS & MERN stack as well.

This is a simple program takes an input from user & display the result accordingly.

Also joins the two given names & displays the full name.

jS highlights :| if-Else | operators | addEventListener | template Literals | 

Styles applied may fit with only laptop screens, yet to complete for other gadgets.

Day by day, will try to enhance this further better...
