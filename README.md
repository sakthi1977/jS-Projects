Hello Everyone!!!

I'm a beginner in coding, learning and practicing HTML, CSS, jS, and the MERN stack as well.

Herewith sharing the javaScript mini projects. Have enclosed the notepad on every folder.

Styles applied may fit with only laptop screens, yet to complete for other gadgets.

Day by day, will try to enhance this further better.
