Hello Everyone!!!

I'm a beginner in coding, learning and practicing HTML, CSS, jS, and the MERN stack as well.

Herewith sharing the javaScript mini projects. Have enclosed the notepad on every folder.

Styles applied may adapt with only laptop & few mobile portrait views, yet to update for mobile landscapes & other gadgets.

Day by day, will try to enhance this further better.
